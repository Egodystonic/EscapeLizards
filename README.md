# EscapeLizards
Source Code for Escape Lizards ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/508940/Escape_Lizards/ )

Code would not compile in its current state as I have had to remove some parts of it due to:
* Sections being under NDA (e.g. steamworks)
* Sections including third-party code or libraries which do not allow redistribution

Therefore the project and solution files have also been removed- codebase is only for demonstration/learning purposes only.

Also missing are all the assets (art, sound, music, textures etc) for the game itself (for obvious reasons).
