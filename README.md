# EscapeLizards
Source Code for Escape Lizards ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/508940/Escape_Lizards/ )

Code will not compile in this current state as I have had to remove some parts of it due to:
* Sections being under NDA (e.g. steamworks)
* Sections including third-party code or libraries which do not allow redistribution

Therefore the project and solution files have also been removed- codebase is only for demonstration/learning purposes only.

Also missing are all the assets (art, sound, music, textures etc) for the game itself (for obvious reasons).

Also if/when I update Escape Lizards I won't update this codebase- this will always be just the state of the code as of 17th May 2017.

A lot of the code is pretty hacky and *not* a good example of quality C#- but I don't have time to filter out the good from the bad- sorry! Consider it a lesson by bad example ;)

If you're interested, I blog at http://benbowen.blog/
